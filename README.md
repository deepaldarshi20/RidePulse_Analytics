# This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow including data extraction, cleansing, transformation (ETL), and visualization. The objective is to derive actionable insights from raw datasets by applying Excel-based preprocessing and advanced Power BI dashboards.
🛠️ Tech Stack:
Excel → Data cleaning, preprocessing, pivot tables, statistical analysis
Power Query (ETL) → Extract, Transform, and Load process
Power BI → Data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard creation, and interactive visualization

The problem was that Ola wanted to analyze performance across different vehicle types, but the raw data was unclean and scattered. I applied ETL using Excel/Power Query, then built an interactive dashboard in Power BI. It highlighted revenue by vehicle type, cancellation trends, and customer ratings. From this, we concluded that Sedans drive revenue but need better cancellation handling, while Bikes ensure customer satisfaction. This kind of analysis helps Ola make data-driven decisions to optimize driver allocation and customer experience.”
